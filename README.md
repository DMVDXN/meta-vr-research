## üìå VR Headset Overview

A virtual reality (VR) headset is a wearable device that immerses users in a computer-generated environment by combining visual, auditory, and motion-tracking technologies. Most modern headsets include high-resolution displays, inside-out tracking cameras, and ergonomic controllers that allow for natural interaction. They are designed to deliver experiences ranging from gaming and entertainment to education, training, and professional applications. Differences between models often come down to factors like display quality, comfort, processing power, and price, which determine the overall level of immersion and usability.
